## What i learned throughtout this small project

While working with this small ecommerce store i learned  ReactJs styled component and implemented the whole 
project with the styled component . Earlier i know a little bit about the styled component but never used it .
But this project is completed implemented with the react styled component. So now i  have better hands on the styled component as well.
